# xkcdDownloader

Who doesn't like xkcd comic strips? I made a little downloading script in Python, that will let you download all of the comics on from the site. I makes use of urllib2 to download the comicstripes.



## How to

Put the script in the same folder you want the comicstripes. E.g. if you want your folders in ~/funny/ you put the script in ~/funny, and run it from there as well.

The script takes one argument, which is the number of the most recent xkcd picture. You can find this number on www.xkcd.com
